# Quadratic-Equation
In this file I used the basic of C++ to calculate the roots of a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula
The program asks for the values of a, b, and c, then uses the concept of discriminant to get the real, equal and imagnary roots of the quadratic equation.
Then t prints the results (precise answer)
